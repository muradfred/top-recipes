        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cooking spray. Can be sunscreen.</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package skinless, boneless unidentified animal breast that looks a lot like a chicken's.</li>
            <li>4 slices of fresh mozzarella. It's cheesy, I know.</li>
            <li>2 cups of weird, dark red juice. Has to smell like tomato sauce. Or taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375F (190 degrees Celcius) To check the temperature, put your hand inside. Spray the animal's breast with your cooking spray of choice, then place it in a pan.</li>
            <li>Then, bake in the oven for however long you can take the stench, and flip it once every twelve minutes. Remove from the oven when you want to, add the red weird sauce, and add the mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake until the cheese melts and the voices in your head stop. After that you're good to go!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And that's how you make a chicken parm! Oh God the voices are talking again make it stopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstop</p>
