        <h2>Learn how to make a delicious steak salad!</h2>
        </center>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 pound non-disclosed steak! Where you got the steak from is your problem. I'm here to make you cook it!</li>
            <li>3 heirloom tomatoes. If they're red and juicy, they're probably tomatoes. I guess.</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion. Again, if they're red and.. uh.. scream when you cut them? They might be onions? Don't overthink it.</li>
            <li>4 cups arugula. Gotta have them arugulas, man.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil. Or, you know, any oil. Car oil, petrol, war on oil. Any kind works. You do you.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar. IF IT'S NOT BALSAMIC THEN GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE</li>
            <li>Sea salt. You can just get this at the nearest beach. Along with the steak.</li>
            <li>Pepper. Can't have the Salt, without the Peppa.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a.. pan. Put the ingredients in it. Look, the only thing that matters is that you make it as soon as you can. Some meats uh.. spoil very fast. And have a stench. And aren't welcomed in our society. Just do it quickly.</li>
            <li>Then, I don't know, add the rest. Put some Salt n Peppa. Then add the Salt and the Pepper.</li>
            <li>Now you eat.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And that's how you make a steak salad! Gotta go, the police are knocking at my door for some reason</p>
