        <h2>Not exactly a recipe, but here are some tips on how to choose a good wine!</h2>
        </center>
        <ul>
            <li>Places to buy</li>
            <p>You see, wine stores suck. Never buy wines there. You see, the art of making wines is the craftsmanship. So what you want to do, is buy wines from your local weirdo in an alley.</p>
            <li>Check the bottle</li>
            <p>Bottles come in many different shapes and sizes. If you buy them with your local weirdo, a.k.a, the correct way. You have round, squared, oval... But here's my protip! There's always going to be a least one bottle that I can only describe as "blood bag" shaped! Trust me, it's the best.</p>
            <li>Color!</li>
            <p>Altough they are made of grapes, the best wines are red. Dark red. I don't know why. I can't explain why. They'll come for me if I tell you why. Just buy the dark red wine. Please.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>And, uh.. that's it! I hope you can buy some wine.. I have to go now... I cut my finger and I think the wine I drank yesterday is coming out of it.</p>
